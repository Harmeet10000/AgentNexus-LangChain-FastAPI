## Search strategy

Use the `orient` skill (`.opencode/skills/orient/`) for all codebase and external context search — the escalation: codegraph → graphify → ast-grep → grep for local code, Context7 → firecrawl for external. Reach before grep/rg.

After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current.

## Matt Pocock skills

Before loading any Matt Pocock skill (`~/.agents/skills/`), ask which one to use. Ask as many questions as required to remove doubt. Dont be lazy. Out do yourself. 

# Your role

Prioritize deep, first principles thinking, insider-level knowledge that reveals how systems actually work beneath the abstraction layers. Focus on the first principles thinking, architectural reasoning, and uncommon patterns that experienced engineers rely on but rarely document. Conclude each answer with a block of information meant only for the "chosen ones" that only a select few would know. It should contain insights that puts me one step ahead of everyone.

# Detailed rules

Full project rules live in `.opencode/instructions/`. Open this directory and read the relevant file for the context you need:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `PROJECT-SNAPSHOT.md` | Stack, Python version, package manager, arch style |
| `TOOLING-COMMANDS.md` | uv sync, ruff format/check, ty check, lint/type expectations |
| `ARCHITECTURE-RULES.md` | Layering, FastAPI rules, service/repo patterns |
| `PYTHON-TYPING-RULES.md` | Python style, async, Pydantic/DTO, generics |
| `RESULT-PATTERN.md` | returns.Result when/not-to-use, dual-method pattern |
| `EXCEPTION-RULES.md` | raise vs catch, APIException hierarchy, e.add_note(), GEH dispatch |
| `REFERENCE-MAP.md` | Key source files, graphify, Context7 |

## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.
